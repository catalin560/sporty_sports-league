# Sporty Sports League

This is my submission for the Sporty Home Assignment. I used Vite to bootstrap a React app and I used Antd for the UI components. For testing I used Vitest with React Testing Library.

## Setup

1. Clone repo `https://github.com/catalin560/sporty_sports-league.git`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run project with `npm start`

To run tests use `npm run test`
